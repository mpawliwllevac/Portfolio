      <description>This is a thing I made: https://mpawliw-levac.shinyapps.io/potionmaster/
Why did I make it?
I&#39;ve spent some time at a school board and was looking to emulate a little bit of what they had. Specifically, the dashboards that were being used.
What did I make?
What I made is a sample dashboard that could be used by a teacher or school staff to help gain deeper knowledge about their students. This could help a teacher potentially see patterns that they wouldn&#39;t have been able to otherwise that they can then adjust their teaching for.</description>
