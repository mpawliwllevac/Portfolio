      <description>What it is- (widget gallery and other references) Shiny is a package that allows individuals to build interactive apps or dashboards in R. They can be hosted on a webpage, downloaded on mobile or even attached to installers and deployed onto other PCs that don&#39;t even have R. Other software most similar to Shiny are Business Intelligence products like Microsoft&#39;s Power BI, or Tableau. My understanding is that the biggest differences between Shiny and other software is the negligible cost (potentially as low as free) and the ease that R can be utilized by it.</description>
