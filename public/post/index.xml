      <description>This is a thing I made: https://mpawliw-levac.shinyapps.io/potionmaster/
Why did I make it?
I&#39;ve spent some time at a school board and was looking to emulate a little bit of what they had. Specifically, the dashboards that were being used.
What did I make?
What I made is a sample dashboard that could be used by a teacher or school staff to help gain deeper knowledge about their students. This could help a teacher potentially see patterns that they wouldn&#39;t have been able to otherwise that they can then adjust their teaching for.</description>

      <title>My Understanding of Shiny</title>

      <description>What it is- (widget gallery and other references) Shiny is a package that allows individuals to build interactive apps or dashboards in R. They can be hosted on a webpage, downloaded on mobile or even attached to installers and deployed onto other PCs that don&#39;t even have R. Other software most similar to Shiny are Business Intelligence products like Microsoft&#39;s Power BI, or Tableau. My understanding is that the biggest differences between Shiny and other software is the negligible cost (potentially as low as free) and the ease that R can be utilized by it.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>
      <link>/2016/12/30/a-plain-markdown-post/</link>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
