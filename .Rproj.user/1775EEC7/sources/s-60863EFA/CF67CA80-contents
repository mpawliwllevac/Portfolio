Hello you,

I'm a budding data analyst with experience in R for statistical programming, knowledge mobilization, academic publication and presentation of data to people with a non-research background. I also have numerous hobbies including: origami, and board games. Currently my goal is expanding my portfolio. I love looking at the world and using tools like R to help analyze and understand the things around me.
